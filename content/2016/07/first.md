## list

* Red
* Green
* Blue
+ Hot
+ Cold
+ Warm
- Japan
 + Tokyo
 + Kyoto
- China
 - Beijing
 - Shanghai


+ If you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.
*   A list item with a blockquote:

    > This is a blockquote
    > inside a list item.
